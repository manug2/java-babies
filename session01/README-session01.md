<br/>

**Lab 1 - jshell**
- Start jshell
- Add variable `mass`
- Assign a value to variable `mass` of 5 `gram`
- Add a constant `c` denoting speed of light as 300 `million-meters per second`.
- Calculate Energy using E=mc2 formula.

- Need a volunteer who is experienced in java
- Calculate Energy using `c` as 300,000,000 `meter per second`.
- Discuss the observation.
  - `int` uses 4 bytes
  - 2^32 combinations - 2147483647
  - `long` type uses 8 bytes


<br/>

**Lab 2 - `.java` file**
- Create an empty file called Emc2.java
- Start with `public class `
- Add `public static void main `
- Implement E=mc2 as done in jshell
    - Using sysout present a sentence to show inputs.
    - Using sysout present a sentence to show output.
- Use Scanner to take inputs instead of hard-coded methods.
